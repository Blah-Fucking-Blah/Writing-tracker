# ✦ The Writing Tracker

> *"Bleed onto the page."*

A minimalist word tracker and sprint timer designed for authors, and ADHD brains. 

Designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages and embedded directly into **Notion**.

## ⚡ Features

* **The Daily goal:** A visual progress ring that fills as you meet your daily word count goals.
* **The Sprint mod:** A dedicated timer for writing sprints. 
    * *Visual Panic:* The timer includes a "heartbeat" animation that intensifies as you enter the final minute of a sprint.
* **Streak Tracking:** keep the chain alive. Logic is adjusted for late-night writers (so 2 AM sessions don't break your streak).
* **Privacy First:** Zero data leaves your device. All stats are saved to your browser's Local Storage.
* **Atmospheric UI:** Deep violets, gothic fonts (`Cinzel`), and subtle glow effects.
